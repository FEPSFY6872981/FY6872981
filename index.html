    <h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
    <p>
        This essay explores the effect artificial intelligence (AI) has on the job market, focusing on the customer service, manual labour, and administration sectors. AI has become comfortable with performing routine tasks without human intervention like with customer service chatbots. Due to AI’s efficiency, the manual labour sector has seen dramatic economic improvement with reduction in defects and manufacturing periods. In administration, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is used for data management which allow workers to prioritise purposeful tasks. Companies view AI as a complement rather than replacement of human workers resulting in job requirement shifts that now prioritise soft skills which AI cannot do.
    </p>
    <p>
        To fully understand the impact AI has we will be exploring how AI impacts each sector respectively; the extent of tasks AI can perform to benefit workers; then considering the potential of AI outperforming workers and the impact this may have on employment.
    </p>

    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        The ever-increasing capabilities of AI have led to its integration in the workplace and transforming it. It is said that “Artificial Intelligence has achieved super-human performance in some tasks” (Trazzi and Yampolskiy, 2020) which questions whether AI will compete with employees for their jobs due to its enhanced efficiency. Research has shown that AI will substitute human labour mostly in the service, production, and administration sectors (Mfanafuthi, Nyawo and Mashau, 2019), potentially putting these workers at risk and altering the demand for these jobs.
    </p>

    <h2 id="customer-service">AI's Impact on Customer Service</h2>
    <p>
        The use of AI in customer service has changed how organisations connect with customers. The number of human calling agents used to deal with customer enquiries has decreased. This was evident in the Thai organisation CP All, which saw a 60% reduction in the call load, after implementing the conversational chatbot (Oliveri, 2024). This demonstrates AI’s capability of serving customers without human intervention, indicating that there’s a declining demand in customer service sector. This idea was reinforced when Facebook publicised that 66% percent of people would prefer to message rather than phone customer care (Krishnan, et al. 2022).
    </p>
    <p>
        To oppose this, AI chat boxes are often met with annoyance by customers as they fall short of expectation to fully understand their needs, with 70% deeming their interactions with chatbots as failures (Song et al, 2022). This suggests that customers value human interaction in customer service meaning that exclusively relying on AI chatbots will not meet customer desires.
    </p>

    <h2 id="manual-labour">AI's Impact on Manual Labour Jobs</h2>
    <p>
        The labour market has experienced increased productivity after the implementation of AI such as automating assembly lines and on demand manufacturing (pwc, 2018, p.10). Due to the repetitive nature of these jobs, AI is easily able to perform these tasks and findings have shown that occupations have shifted from being routine and manual to being more interactive and analytical (Josten and Lorden, 2023).
    </p>
    <p>
        This is supported in a review of China’s manufacturing industry, where it was found that for every 1% rise in the use of robots, labour force jobs fell by 4.6% (Huo, Ruan and Cui, 2024). This clearly demonstrates the declining demand for manual labour in the job market, as it can be replaced by automation to optimize economic output and accelerate operations. The Chief Production and Technology Officer of Beko stated that the applications of AI has prevented defects in the production of sheet metal resulting in 12.5% material cost saving as well as cutting the defect rates by 66%. The advanced machine learning algorithms also reduced time to market by 46% (Schönfuß, 2024).
    </p>

    <h2 id="administration">AI's Impact on Administration</h2>
    <p>
        Comparing the computer to brain frequencies, our neurons can operate at a peak speed of 200Hz compared to a modern microprocessor’s speed of 2 GHz (Trazzi and Yamolskiy, 2020). This allows AI to handle time-consuming administration such as organising and managing data much faster which frees employees work on more engaging tasks.
    </p>

    <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
        AI’s effect on the job market varies across sectors, depending on the skills required. Its most common use is automating repetitive tasks which are found in many fields, using systems like RPA. The growth of AI has created new roles however workers must develop the soft skills needed to fulfil this as every job requires human aspects which AI cannot fully replicate, therefore clarifying that AI will not eliminate jobs but instead reshape the existing ones.
