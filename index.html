  <h1>Introudction</h1>
    <p>The ever-increasing capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to its integration in the workplace. It is said that “Artificial Intelligence has achieved super-human performance in some tasks” (Michaël Trazzi, 2020) and so this poses the question whether this high-level performance will compete with employees for their jobs. To answer the title ‘how has artificial intelligence affected the job market’’, we need to explore different job sectors and see how AI impacts them respectively. Research has shown that AI will substitute human labour mostly in the service, production, office and administration sectors (Mbali Mfanafuthi, 2019). To fully understand the impact AI has on these we need to know, the extent of tasks AI can perform to benefits workers. Then, we will consider the potential of AI outperforming workers and the impact this may have on employment.</p>

   <h2>AI's mpact on customer service</h2>
    <p>The use of AI in customer service has changed how organisations connect with customers.  The number of human calling agents used to deal with customer enquiries has decreased and this was evident in the Thai organisation CP All which saw a 60% reduction in the call load, after having implemented the conversational chatbot (Oliveri, 2024). This demonstrates AI’s capability of serving customers without human intervention, potentially meaning that there’s a declining demand for employment in customer service market. This idea was reinforced when Facebook publicised that 66% percent of people would prefer to message rather than phone customer care (Chitra Krishnan, 2022)</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>To oppose this, it is known that the AI chat boxes are often met with annoyance by customers as they fall short of expectation to fully understand their needs, with 70% deeming their interactions with chatbots as failures (Mengmeng Song a, 2022). This suggests that customers still value human interaction for customer service meaning that exclusively relying on AI chatbots will not meet customer desires.</p>
