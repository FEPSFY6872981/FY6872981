  <h1>Introudction</h1>
    
    <p>The ever-increasing capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to its integration in the workplace. It is said that “Artificial Intelligence has achieved super-human performance in some tasks” (Michaël Trazzi, 2020) and so this poses the question whether this high-level performance will compete with employees for their jobs. To answer the title ‘how has artificial intelligence affected the job market’’, we need to explore different job sectors and see how AI impacts them respectively. Research has shown that AI will substitute human labour mostly in the service, production, office and administration sectors (Mbali Mfanafuthi, 2019). To fully understand the impact AI has on these we need to know, the extent of tasks AI can perform to benefits workers. Then, we will consider the potential of AI outperforming workers and the impact this may have on employment.</p>

   <h2>AI's mpact on customer service</h2>
    
    <p>The use of AI in customer service has changed how organisations connect with customers.  The number of human calling agents used to deal with customer enquiries has decreased and this was evident in the Thai organisation CP All which saw a 60% reduction in the call load, after having implemented the conversational chatbot (Oliveri, 2024). This demonstrates AI’s capability of serving customers without human intervention, potentially meaning that there’s a declining demand for employment in customer service market. This idea was reinforced when Facebook publicised that 66% percent of people would prefer to message rather than phone customer care (Chitra Krishnan, 2022)</p>
    
    <p>To oppose this, it is known that the AI chat boxes are often met with annoyance by customers as they fall short of expectation to fully understand their needs, with 70% deeming their interactions with chatbots as failures (Mengmeng Song a, 2022). This suggests that customers still value human interaction for customer service meaning that exclusively relying on AI chatbots will not meet customer desires.</p>
    
    <p>Difference between what customer wants/expectation of AI vs what they actually recieive/what AI has to offer currently</p>

  <h3>AI’s impact on manual labour jobs</h3>

    <p>The labour market has experienced increased productivity after the implementation of AI such as automating assembly lines and on demand manufacturing (pwc, 2018). Due to the repetitive nature of these jobs, AI is easily able to perform these tasks and findings have shown that occupations have shifted from being routine and manual to being more interactive and analytical (Lordan, 2023). This is supported in a review of China’s manufacturing industry, where it was found that for every 1% rise in the use of robots, labour force jobs fell by 4.6% (Qingqing Huo, 2024). This clearly demonstrates the declining demand for manual labour in the job market, as it is viewed as a lower-skill role that can be replaced by automation to optimize economic output and accelerate operations. The Chief Production and Technology Officer of Beko has stated that the applications of AI has prevented defects in the production of sheet metal resulting in 12.5% material cost saving as well as cutting the defect rates by 66%. The advanced machine learning algorithms has also reduced time to market by 46% (Schönfuß, 2024). 
These statistics confirm the economic benefits of applying AI and reducing human labour in the manufacturing process, as it positively impacts various aspects of the business, however  this introduces the risk to employment in the manual labour market.
</p>
    
    <p>In contrary, surveys have revealed that businesses’ are more motivated to adopt AI to complement human capabilities rather than substituting workers (Marguerita Lane, 2021). This suggests that complete AI automation in the manual labour market is highly unlikely due to the complexity and variability of certain tasks however an increase in AI implementation will be observed.</p>
    
    <p>So the effect of AI on the manual labour job market ultimately depends on the skill set required of the specific job and whether AI is capable of replicating the professionals’ work.</p>

  <h4>AI's impact on adminstration</h4>

    <p>Computers can process data in larger volumes than humans. The algorithms can learn from this data and apply the knowledge to new situations (Jelena Stajic, 2015). When we compare the computer to brain frequencies, our biological neurones can operate at a peak speed of 200Hz compared to a modern microprocessor’s speed of 2 GHz (Michaël Trazzi, 2020). This allows AI to handle time-consuming administration such as organising and managing data much faster which frees employees work on more engaging tasks</p>
